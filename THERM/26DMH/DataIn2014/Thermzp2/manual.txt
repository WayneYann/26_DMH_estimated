                                                 DAT files require 80 character records
                                                 while DOC files require 70  character 
                                                 records.   In  sequential files, record
                                                 length varies from line to line, therefore
                                                 if one edits a file using a word  processor
                                                 this utility may be used to pad each record     
                                                 to  the  required length.  All editing  must  be 
                                                 done as ASCII files w/ no formatting.

                    To  boot  up  THERM place the disk marked "THERM  PROGRAM  DISK: 
                    DRIVE  A:"  in drive A and then reboot your computer (  "Ctrl-Alt-

                    return.  The program title page should appear with the message:

                    When all files are loaded,  the number of groups in the  database 
                    is displayed.  Hit return and you advance to the main menu:

                    SAMPLE  SESSION:      Calculate and file thermodynamic properties 
                                        of PHENOL and PHENOXY RADICAL.
                    
                    
                    note:   Help is available for most input if "?" is entered instead 
                    of  the requested input.    The letter "Q" (upper or lower case) is  a 
                    reserved character used to "QUIT" back to a previous menu or point  in 






                    the program.   As  a  result the first character of  a  species  ID 
                    should not begin with either of these characters (Q or ?).  
                    SHORT SAMPLE SESSION:
                    
                    In  the following paragraphs,  quote marks are used for  emphasis 
                    only.  You should only enter what is inside the quote marks.
                    
                    1.    At  the  main menu prompt hit return to accept the  default 
                    option "1 - ENTER/ESTIMATE SPECIES".
                    
                    2.    You  are  now asked to "enter species  name  (ID)".   Enter 
                    "phenol"  followed by a return (upper or lower case are accepted; 
                    but THERM converts all strings to capital letters).
                    
                    3.   At this point you are asked to enter the "elemental formula" 
                    for the species.  Enter "C6H5OH" or "C6H6O" whichever you prefer.
                    
                    4.   You are now asked to verify that the formula was interpreted 
                    correctly.  Hit return if correct or enter "Q" if it was not.
                    
                    5.    After a brief description of how THERM calculates radicals, 
                    you  are  asked to enter the number of groups  in  this  species.  
                    Phenol  is  comprised of 5 - CB/H groups,  1  - CB/O  group,  and 
                    1  - O/CB/H group.   This is a total of 7 groups.   Enter "7"  at 
                    this prompt.  
                    
                         If one wants to enter literature data instead of estimating
                    thermo properties using Benson's method, they should simply enter 
                    "0" when prompted for the number of groups in the species.  THERM
                    will then prompt for literature data to be input.
                    
                    6.    You  are now asked to enter the number of different  groups 
                    which are present in this species.  Above we see that PHENOL only 
                    has 3 different groups.  Enter "3" at this prompt.
                    
                    7.    Enter the number of rotors (tops) in the species.   Default 
                    is  no rotors.  The number of rotors is used to adjust  the  high 
                    temperature limiting heat capacity.  Phenol has 1 rotor ( -OH  ), 
                    enter 1 and press return.
                    
                    8.    It  is  now time to enter the groups which are  present  in 
                    phenol.  Enter the following:
                            "CB/H,5"                 (note 1: a blank or comma are the
                                                       same. "CB/H 5" is equivalent.)
                            "CB/O"                   (note 2: if no quantity is entered
                                                       quantity "1" is understood)
                            "O/CB/H"
                    
                         In group names,  slashes delimit atoms or functional groups.  The 
                    letters appearing before the first slash represent the central atom or 
                    next nearest neighbor (or other) correction ( ex:  C/, O/,or /N (central 
                    atom) or CIS/, ORT/, /MET, GAUCHE/, or OI/ (corrections)).
                    
                         The  atoms  or functional groups that follow are  each  delimited 
                    with  slashes  "/"  and  appear  in  alphabetic  order  (ex:   Bensons 






                    O-(H)(C)   would   be  O/C/H,   C-(Cd)(C)2(H)  would  be   C/C2/CD/H2, 
                    AND C-(Cd)(CB)(H)2 would be C/CB/CD/H2 ).
                    
                    
                    9.    The  symmetry number for phenol is 2.   Enter "2"  at  this 
                    prompt.
                    
                    The  SPECIES SCREEN appears showing all data entered in  addition 
                    to  the thermodynamic properties which have been calculated.   An 
                    EDIT option is available; enter "?" for more details (we will not 
                    edit at this point).
                    
                    
                    10.    Hit  return  to advance to the SPECIES  ESTIMATION  OPTIONS 
                    MENU.
                    
                    
                    11.  Choose option "F" to add this species to a file.
                    
                    12.  You are asked for a filename.  Enter "B:THERMO".
                    
                    13.   Since "B:THERMO.LST" already exists,  the following message 
                    appears:
                              THERMO.LST already exists:
                    
                              1 - DELETE (OVERWRITE)
                              2 - APPEND (ADD TO THE END OF THE FILE)
                              3 - ENTER A DIFFERENT FILENAME
                    
                              ENTER OPTION:
                    
                    We want to add Phenol to the end of this file so enter "2".
                    
                    14.  Similarly "B:THERMO.DOC" already exists. Again enter "2" and 
                    the data for phenol will be added to the end of these files.
                    
                    You  now  have returned to the SPECIES ESTIMATION  OPTIONS  MENU.  
                    Note  that you are notified that PHENOL is the last species  that 
                    you  have filed.   Now that these files are connected you  will 
                    not be asked to input the filename when filing.  To close or change output
                    files "Q" quit back to the MAIN menu and choose option "*".
                    
                    15.  One can now calculate the properties of PHENOXY radical.  To 
                    do  this choose option "R".   The RADICAL ESTIMATION MENU appears 
                    listing all bond dissociation "BD" increments which are  defined.  
                    For  a  description  of these increments enter "?" and  then  the 
                    increment  group name (not the group number) when prompted.   We
                    are interested  in  the "PHENOXY" bond dissociation increment.   
                    Enter "PHENOXY" when you are done looking at the help on these groups.
                    
                    16.  You must now enter the symmetry number for PHENOXY radical.
                    Enter  "2" at this prompt.   Had the symmetry number been  1  you 
                    could have just hit return since if no symmetry number is entered 
                    "1" is assumed.
                    






                    17.   Now enter the name for your radical (9 characters maximum).  
                    Enter "PHENOXY" or "C6H5O." whichever you prefer.
                    
                    18.  The formula for phenoxy is C6H5O; so enter "C6H5O".
                    
                    19.   Hit  return  to confirm that the elemental  composition  is 
                    correct.
                    
                    20.   The  species  screen  now  displays the  data  for  PHENOXY 
                    radical.  Hit return to advance to the SPECIES ESTIMATION OPTIONS 
                    MENU.
                    
                    21.  Choose option "F" and PHENOXY's data is added to the current 
                    file (since the file is already initilized you are not asked  for 
                    any  additional  input).   You return to the  SPECIES  ESTIMATION 
                    OPTIONS  MENU automatically and are notified that PHENOXY is  the 
                    last species which you filed.
                    
                    22.   At this point you can review the help which is available on 
                    the other options.   Entering "M" will return you to PHENOL where 
                    you  could use the edit option to change/add groups to estimate a 
                    substituted phenol for example meta-ChloroPhenol.
                    
                    Note:   Phenoxy  radical  could  have  been  calculated  directly 
                    (without  calculating PHENOL first) if you had used  the  RADICAL 
                    GROUP  "O/CB/."  when  first entering groups.   Both  methods  of 
                    radical calculation are supported, however, use of RADICAL GROUPS 
                    in  the case of resonantly stabilized allylic species may  result 
                    in  a  significant  error.   These  groups  do  not  address  the 
                    resonance  stabilization  energy accounted by BD  BOND  INCREMENT 
                    GROUPS.

                          This option invokes THERM'S code to calculate thermodynamic
                          properties using Benson's group additivity method.
                    
                         To estimate molecular or radical species you will be
                         asked for specific information about the species, such as:
                    
                      *   Species ID  { limited to 9 characters so as to fit CHEMKIN

                        This option allows you to review the group database currently
                        in memory.  This is useful if you are looking for a group, but
                        have forgotten its name.

                       a menu is on the screen.
                    
                       The MAIN menu is not affected by this option.
                    
                       LONG menu shows all information
                    
                       SHORT menu only lists available options with no description

                        8 - RUN THERMFIT:  CREATE NASA FORMAT FILE {*.DAT}
                    
                      This option spawns THERM'S heat capacity extrapolation/polynomial
                      fitting program : THERMFIT.
                    
                       "LST" file format is used as input to the program "THERMFIT.EXE".
                    
                      This program converts thermo data to polynomials in NASA format
                      for use with CHEMKIN or other codes which require this format and
                      allow one to specify a common temperature other than 1000 K.
                    
                      Two sets of polynomials are generated with a common (breakpoint) temperature
                      determined so as to match Cp and dCp/dT.  This break point is 
                      typically not the more common 1000 K as with SANDIA'S fitting code.

                      This program allows one to enter reaction expressions such as:
                    
                         C6H5CL=CYC6H5. + CL
                         
                     and have property change of reaction calculated from NASA format
                     polynomials in addition to the ratio of forward/reverse A factors.
                    
                     Data are taken from "DAT" files and one is prompted for a *.DAT
                     filename.  {OBVIOUSLY ALL SPECIES ID'S ENTERED IN THE
                     REACTION EXPRESSION MUST APPEAR IN  THE SPECIFIED "DAT" FILE }.
                    
                     Entire CHEMKIN input files can also be processed automatically.

                     OPTION 10:
                    
                      10 - Sort, Recalculate, & ReWrite THERMO FILES { *.DOC, *.LST }
                    
                      This option is essentially the same as OPTION 7 except the "DOC"
                      file is first sorted in order of elemental composition.  
                    
                      Sorting is performed on the # of levels defined in the configuration
                      file "THERM.CFG".  The key word "#KEYS" is followed by the number of
                      sort keys (or levels). The priority for sorting is determined by the 
                      order elements appear in "THERM.CFG" (configuration file).
                    
                      For example: if the configuration file contains the following   
                      elements in the following order ( each element actually appears on a
                      separate line ):
                    
                       C  H O  CL N BR   (and #KEYS 2 )  
                    
                      Data is first sorted in order of increasing carbon number; then
                      each sub group is sorted by increasing hydrogen number. If #KEYS 3
                      appears in the file "THERM.CFG" then sorting would continue
                      by oxygen number.  If the order elements appear in "THERM.CFG" is
                      changed, so is the order of sorting.
                      
                      Literature data are not recalculated.

                      Same sorting procedure as OPTION 10; but DATABASE RECALCULATION
                      is not performed.
                    
                      This option is useful if one wants to sort a "LST" file but has no
                      documentation file to recalculate the database.

                      This option toggles the units which results are displayed on screen
                      and saved in documentation files.  Units can either be Kcal/mol (Hf)
                      and cal/mol K (S and Cp) or KJ/mol (Hf) and J/mol K (S and Cp).
                    
                     This has no effect on units saved in a "LST" file.  If one adds data 
                     to a "LST" file, units remain the same as those already in use in
                     that file.  If one starts a new "LST" file they will be prompted for
                     units.
                    
                      Units may be changed at various other parts of the program.

                          THIS IS USEFUL IF YOU CHANGE A GROUP TO FORM A NEW SPECIES 
                          RATHER THAN RE-ENTERING ALL GROUPS IN THAT SPECIES.  IT IS 
                          ALSO USEFUL IF YOU MADE AN ERROR IN THE SPECIES NAME OR 
                          FORMULA.  IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE SPECIES ID WITHOUT
                          CHANGING THE FORMULA, ENTER A BLANK WHEN ASKED FOR THE NEW

                        6 - ADD A GROUP TO THE CURRENT SPECIES
                    
                       THIS OPTION IS USEFUL IF YOU FORGOT A GROUP OR IF YOU ARE 
                       CREATING A NEW SPECIES BY EDITING THE GROUPS OF THE CURRENT
                       SPECIES.  THIS OPTION  IS ONLY ENABLED FOR STABLE MOLECULES

                        7 - DELETE A GROUP FROM THE CURRENT SPECIES
                    
                       THIS OPTION IS USEFUL IF YOU ARE CREATING A NEW SPECIES BY EDITING
                       THE CURRENT GROUPS.  THIS OPTION  IS ONLY ENABLED FOR STABLE 
                       MOLECULES AND RADICALS WHICH WERE CALCULATED USING RADICAL GROUPS
                       "CDOT"; not enabled for any BD increments.
                    
                    






                     OPTION 8:
                      
                       8 - CHANGE A GROUP
                    
                       THIS OPTION ALLOWS YOU TO CREATE A NEW SPECIES BY EDITING THE 
                       GROUPS FROM THE PREVIOUS SPECIES.  THIS IS THE MOST USEFUL OPTION
                       OF THE THREE (6, 7, 8).  YOU CAN CHANGE THE GROUP ID AND/OR 
                       QUANTITY.
                    
                       EXAMPLE:
                       STARTING WITH BENZENE:  "CB/H,6"; EDIT/ESTIMATE CHLOROBENZENE.
                       YOU CAN CHANGE THIS FROM "CB/H,6" TO "CB/H,5"
                       THEN YOU CAN SELECT OPTION "6" ADD A GROUP; AND ADD "CB/CL".
                       NOW YOU HAVE THE GROUPS FOR CHLOROBENZENE. ALL YOU HAVE TO
                       DO IS CHANGE THE SYMMETRY NUMBER, FORMULA, AND SPECIES ID.
                    
                       THIS MIGHT NOT SEEM LIKE IT SAVES WORK; BUT IF YOU HAVE A 
                       SPECIES WITH 10 OR 15 DIFFERENT GROUPS, AND ALL YOU NEED TO 
                       CHANGE IS ONE TO CREATE YOUR NEW SPECIES, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT
                       SAVINGS IN TIME OVER ENTERING ALL 10 - 15 GROUPS.

                    OPTION 9:
                    
                         9 - Change the number of rotors in the species
                    
                         This allows one to change the number of rotors which are
                         considered to be free rotors at high temperature (5000 K).
                    
                         Molecules with attached tops that have large barriers to internal
                         rotation ( V > 10 kcal/mol) cannot be considered free rotations 
                         even at high temperature.  
                      
                         The number of free rotors changes the limiting heat capacity
                         Cp infinity, since each vibrational mode contributes 1 heat
                         capacity unit while a free rotation only contributes 1/2 a
                         heat capacity unit and a vibrational mode is lost when a free
                         rotor exists.

                       6 - CHANGE BOND DISSOCIATION ENERGY FOR A RADICAL
                    
                      THIS OPTION ALLOWS YOU TO ALTER THE BOND ENERGY FROM ONE OF THE
                      BD GROUPS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS.  A NEW GROUP CALLED "DELTA BOND 
                      ENERGY" IS CREATED AND ADDED TO THE DOCUMENTATION FILE.
                    
                      AN EXAMPLE IS THE ESTIMATION OF THE CHLOROPHENYL RADICAL.
                    
                      THE BOND ENERGY USED FOR LOSS OF H ATOM FROM BENZENE IS 113.5 Kcal.
                      THAT FOR LOSS OF H ATOM FROM CHLOROBENZENE IS LOWER BY ABOUT 1 Kcal.
                    
                      TO CREATE CHLOROPHENYL RADICAL YOU CAN APPLY THE "BZ" BOND INCREMENT
                      GROUP TO CHLOROBENZENE AND THEN USE THIS OPTION TO CORRECT THE
                      BOND ENERGY USED IN THE CALCULATION OF CHLOROPHENYL TO 112.5 Kcal.

                     THIS OPTION IS THE SAME AS OPTION "M" FROM THE SPECIES ESTIMATION
                     OPTIONS MENU.  IT IS INCLUDED HERE FOR CONVENIENCE ONLY.

                         8 - Change the number of rotors in the species
                    
                         This allows one to change the number of rotors which are
                         considered to be free rotors at high temperature (5000 K).
                    
                         Molecules with attached tops that have large barriers to internal

                         even at high temperature.  
                      
                         The number of free rotors changes the limiting heat capacity

                          NOTE:  this is a sample LST format file ( *.LST ) as created by the
                          group additivity code.  LST files produced by THERMLST have essentially
                          the same format, except Cp 1500 K is never blank or zero.
                    
                      o   If Cp 1500 K is blank or zero that means one or more groups considered 
                          had no data available at this temperature.  Once data has been fit using
                          this program, Cp data will be calculated to 5000 K unless an asterisk appears
                          in column 1.  An asterisk in column 1 "*" indicates that the desired 
                          temperature range is limited to 2000 K or that extrpolation was not successful.
                    
                     o    The last column contains the number of rotors which can be considered
                          free rotors at high temperature.  This is used to adjust the high temp
                          limiting heat capacity ( Cp infinity ).

                        temperature.  This fitting method determines the best position for the breakpoint
                        rather than holding it constant at 1000 K.

                       NOTE:   If one wants to use a polynomial file which was not created by  this 
                    package,  it will be necessary to run the utility program "STOD.EXE" to  verify 
                    the  record length is 80 characters per line.  THERMRXN requires the first  two 
                    lines  of the polynomial format file to be padded with blanks to 80  characters 
                    (required  record  length).  STOD will do this automatically.  This  is  called 
                    DIRECT ACCESS FILE FORMAT.  STOD stands for Sequential TO Direct conversion.  
                    
                       Failure to pad each line to 80 characters will result in a an error message.  
                    The  polynomial  file  supplied with Sandia's "CHEMKIN"  requires  this  change 
                    before it can be read.  This format change is transparent to the CHEMKIN  code, 
                    and allows quicker operation
                    when used with THERM.
