



 OPTION 8
    8 - RUN THERMFIT:  CREATE NASA FORMAT FILE {*.DAT}:

  This option spawns THERM'S heat capacity extrapolation/polynomial
  fitting program : THERMFIT.

   "LST" file format is used as input to the program "THERMFIT.EXE".

  This program converts thermo data to polynomials in NASA format
  for use with CHEMKIN or other codes which require this format and
  allow one to specify a common temperature other than 1000 K.

  Two sets of polynomials are generated with a common temperature
  determined so as to match Cp and dCp/dT.  This break point is 
  typically not the more common 1000 K as with SANDIA'S fitting code.
 END

 OPTION 9
   9 - RUN THERMRXN: REACTION ANALYSIS ( del H, del U, del S, del G):

  This program allows one to enter reaction expressions such as:

     C6H5CL=CYC6H5. + CL
     
 and have property change of reaction calculated from NASA format
 polynomials in addition to the ratio of forward/reverse A factors.

 Data are taken from "DAT" files and one is prompted for a *.DAT
 filename.  {OBVIOUSLY ALL SPECIES ID'S ENTERED IN THE
 REACTION EXPRESSION MUST APPEAR IN  THE SPECIFIED "DAT" FILE }.

 Entire CHEMKIN input files can also be processed automatically.

 END

 OPTION 10
  10 - Sort & ReWrite THERMO FILES { *.DOC, *.LST }:

  This option is essentially the same as OPTION 7 except the "DOC"
  file is first sorted in order of elemental composition.  

  Sorting is performed on the # of levels defined in the configuration
  file "THERM.CFG".  The key word "#KEYS" is followed by the number of
  sort keys (or levels). The priority for sorting is determined by the 
  order elements appear in "THERM.CFG" (configuration file).

  For example: if the configuration file contains the following   
  elements in the following order ( each element actually appears on a
  separate line ):

   C  H O  CL N BR   (and #KEYS 2 )  

  Data is first sorted in order of increasing carbon number; then
  each sub group is sorted by increasing hydrogen number. If #KEYS 3
  appears in the file "THERM.CFG" then sorting would continue
  by oxygen number.  If the order elements appear in "THERM.CFG" is
  changed, so is the order of sorting.
 END

 OPTION 11
    11 - SORT/REWRITE *.LST FILE or CHANGE file Units:

  Same sorting procedure as OPTION 10; but DATABASE RECALCULATION
  is not performed.

  To Change Units (Kcal to KJ, or visa versa),  answer "N" when
  prompted "Sort Database (Y/N/Q)?   {Y}".  Sorting by composition 
  will be suppressed, and you must enter the desired units for the
  new output file when prompted.

  This option is useful if one wants to sort a "LST" file but has no
  documentation file to recalculate the database,  or if one wants to
  change a file from one set of units to another ( Kcal <---> KJ ).

 END
 OPTION 12
  12 - RUN THERMLST: CONVERT NASA FORMAT "DAT" FILE TO "LST" FORMAT:

  This option spawns THERM'S listing program : THERMLST.EXE

  A *.LST FORMAT FILE IS CREATED FROM A NASA FORMAT *.DAT FILE.
  COEFFICIENTS ARE READ AND HEAT CAPACITY VALUES ARE GENERATED AT
  300, 400, 500, 600, 800, 1000, 1500 deg K. (An extended listing
  to 5000 K  may also be created.)

 END


 OPTION 13
    13 - DOS UTILITIES:

  ALLOWS ONE TO INVOKE THE DOS INTERPRETER FROM WITHIN THE PROGRAM.
  SEVERAL OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE. CHOOSE THIS OPTION (12) FOR MORE 
  DETAILS.

 END
 
 OPTION U
    U - CHANGE UNITS
 
  This option toggles the units which results are displayed on screen
  and saved in documentation files.  Units can either be Kcal/mol: Hf
  and cal/mol K: S and Cp; or KJ/mol: Hf and J/mol K: S and Cp.

 This has no effect on units saved in a "LST" file.  If one adds data 
 to a "LST" file, units remain the same as those already in use in
 that file.  If one starts a new "LST" file they will be prompted for
 units.

  Units may be changed at various oter parts of the program.

 END

 OPTION *
     * - CLOSE ALL OPENED FILES

  This option is necessary to change the ouput or other files that are
  connected. 


 END

 OPTION X
   X - EXIT PROGRAM:

  ENDS THERM SESSION , CLOSES ALL FILES, AND RETURNS TO DOS.

 END

 OPTION ?
   ? - HELP:

  MAKES THIS HELP INFORMATION AVAILABLE.

 END 

 OPTION SORT/Y/N/Q
	Sort Database (Y/N/Q)?       :  {Y}  

    To suppress sorting of the "LST" file prior to output answer
  "N" to this prompt.

   This is useful if one wants to convert an existing "LST" file
  from one set of units to another ( Kcal <---> KJ )  and does 
  not want the file to be sorted.

  SORTING LARGE FILES ON MANY LEVELS ( KEY ELEMENTS ) MAY TAKE
  A VERY LONG TIME.   THE NUMBER OF LEVELS FOR SORTING IS DEFINED
  IN THE CONFIGURATION FILE.  { # KEYS }

  "Y" is the default: proceed with sorting.

  "Q" will abort this option and return to the MAIN MENU.   

  All other responses are interpreted as "Y".
