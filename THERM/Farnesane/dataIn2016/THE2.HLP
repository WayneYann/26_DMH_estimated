 OPTION CHSYMM

	CHANGE SYMMETRY NUMBER:

   ENTER HERE A NEW VALUE FOR THE SYMMETRY NUMBER OF THE CURRENT
   SPECIES. 
  
   THE DEFAULT IS TO MAKE NO CHANGE.

   HIT RETURN WHEN ASKED FOR A NEW SYMMETRY NUMBER FOR NO CHANGE,
   OR ENTER A NEW SYMMETRY NUMBER AT THE PROMPT.

 END
 OPTION CHFORM

       CHANGE FORMULA:

  IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE/UPDATE THE SPECIES FORMULA YOU SHOULD
  ENTER THE NEW FORMULA WHEN PROMPTED.

  70 CHARACTERS MAX.

  A BLANK IS INTERPRETED AS NO CHANGE.   

 END
 OPTION CHSPEC

        CHANGE SPECIES ID:

  ENTER THE NEW SPECIES ID WHEN PROMPTED: MAXIMUM OF 9 CHARACTERS.

  A BLANK IS INTERPRETED AS NO CHANGE.  

 END
 OPTION TEXT

      ENTER TEXT TO SPECIES SCREEN:

    UP TO 50 LINES OF TEXT CAN BE ADDED TO THE SPECIES SCREEN
    AND DOCUMENTATION FILE  FOR ANY SPECIES.

    A BLANK LINE OR THE KEY CHARACTER "Q" TERMINATE THE TEXT FIELD.

    WHEN ONE CHOOSES TO EDIT TEXT, ANY TEXT PREVIOUSLY ENTERED FOR
    THAT SPECIES IS LOST.
 
    ADDING MORE THAN A FEW LINES OF TEXT MAY MAKE PART OF THE SPECIES
    SCREEN SCROLL OUT OF VIEW; USE "Ctrl S" TO STOP AND START SCROLL
    IF NEEDED.

 END
 OPTION MODIFY

          MODIFY THERMO:

     THIS ALLOWS YOU TO CHANGE THE CALCULATED Hf, S, Cp 's FOR THE
     CURRENT SPECIES.

     YOU MAY ADD AN INCREMENT (NO "+" SIGN) OR A DECREMENT (PRECEDED
     BY A "-" SIGN)   REAL OR INTEGER VALUES ARE ACCEPTED.

     ENTER  THE NUMBER OF THE OPTION YOU WANT TO MODIFY WHEN PROMPTED.


 END
 OPTION ADD/REPLACE

          ADD OR REPLACE THE VALUE OF THE SPECIFIED FIELD:

 AT THIS PROMPT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO SELECT "A" TO ADD AN INCREMENT
 OR DECREMENT; OR SELECT "R" TO REPLACE THE VALUE OF THE CHOSEN FIELD.

 A BLANK OR THE KEY LETTER "Q" TERMINATE THIS OPTION WITH NO CHANGE.

 END
 OPTION CORRECTION

     FOR AN INCREMENT SIMPLY ENTER THE NUMBER (REAL OR INTEGER) TO
   BE ADDED TO THE SPECIFIED FIELD.

     FOR A DECREMENT PUT A "-" SIGN BEFORE THE NUMBER .
 
     INTEGER OR REAL VALUES ARE ACCEPTED.

   ALL CHANGES YOU MAKE ARE RECORDED AS A GROUP SO THAT THE VALUE 
   CALCULATED FROM GROUPS PLUS THE CHANGE EQUALS THE DESIRED VALUE
   (NO MATTER HOW MANY CHANGES YOU MAKE TO ONE FIELD).

 A BLANK OR THE KEY LETTER "Q" TERMINATE THIS OPTION WITH NO CHANGE.  

 END

 OPTION NROT
  If the species being considered has internal rotors which can be
  considered essentially free rotors in the high temperature limit
  (5000 K) each should be considered here.
   
  This information is needed to adjust Cp infinity to account for 
  essentially free rotation at high temperature. 

  Cp infinity = (3N - 2)R      for non-linear molecule w/ no 
                               free rotors

              = (3N - (2 + Nr/2))R  for non-linear molecule 
                                    which contains free rotors
                                    ( Nr - number of rotors )
  EXAMPLES:
  species    Nr

  ETHANE     1                    BIPHENYL   1
  PROPANE    2                    BENZENE    0
  METHANE    0                    TOLUENE    1
  XYLENE     2     1,3,5 Trimethylbenzene    3

 END

 OPTION REPLACE

   TO REPLACE THE VALUE IN THE CURRENT FIELD ENTER THE NEW VALUE.

   INTEGER OR REAL VALUES ARE ACCEPTED.

   ALL CHANGES YOU MAKE ARE RECORDED AS A GROUP SO THAT THE VALUE 
   CALCULATED FROM GROUPS PLUS THE CHANGE EQUALS THE DESIRED VALUE
   (NO MATTER HOW MANY CHANGES YOU MAKE TO ONE FIELD).

 A BLANK OR THE KEY LETTER "Q" TERMINATE THIS OPTION WITH NO CHANGE.   


 END
 OPTION BD

  CHANGE THE BOND DISSOCIATION ENERGY USED TO CALCULATE A RADICAL
  FROM A PARENT SPECIES.  

  YOU ARE REQUIRED TO ENTER A NEW BOND ENERGY AT THIS PROMPT IF YOU 
  WANT TO ALTER/UPDATE THE CURRENT VALUE.
  
 A BLANK OR THE KEY LETTER "Q" TERMINATE THIS OPTION WITH NO CHANGE.

 END
 OPTION DELETE

  ENTER HERE THE INTEGER NUMBER OF THE GROUP TO BE DELETED.

 A BLANK OR THE KEY LETTER "Q" TERMINATE THIS OPTION WITH NO CHANGE.

 END
 OPTION CHANGE
  Enter here the integer number of the group to be changed.

 The user is then prompted to either change a group, a quantity for a
 group, or both a group and its quantity.

 A blank or the key letter "Q" terminate this option with no change.
