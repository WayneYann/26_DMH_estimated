
             THERM MAIN MENU HELP FILE

 OPTION 1
      1 - ENTER/ESTIMATE SPECIES:

      This option invokes THERM'S code to calculate thermodynamic
      properties using Benson's group additivity method.

     To estimate molecular or radical species you will be
     asked for specific information about the species, such as:

  *   Species ID  { limited to 9 characters so as to fit CHEMKIN
      format}

  *   # of groups in the species

  *   # of different groups to be entered (DO NOT INCLUDE BD GROUPS)

  *   Elemental formula { limited to 70 characters }

  *   Groups contained in the species

  *   species symmetry number

 END

 OPTION 2
    2 - VIEW GROUPS:
  
    This option allows you to review the group database currently
    in memory.  This is useful if you are looking for a group, but
    have forgotten its name.

 END

 OPTION 3
   3 - SELECT SHORT/LONG MENU:

   This option toggles the amount of information displayed when 
   a menu is on the screen.

   The MAIN menu is not affected by this option.

   LONG menu shows all information

   SHORT menu only lists available options with no description

   In both cases this help information is available.      

 END

 OPTION 4
   4 - CHANGE SPECIES LIST FILE {*.LST}:

    THIS OPTION IS USED TO CHANGE THE "LST" FILE CURRENTLY IN MEMORY.

    THERE ARE A MAXIMUM OF 300 SPECIES ALLOWED AT ANY TIME.

    THIS DATA IS NOT PASSED TO THE REACTION ANALYSIS PROCEDURE
    BUT IS USED FOR SORTING AND REWRITING THE DATABASE.

    THE "LST" FILE CONTAINS THE SPECIES ID (9 CHARACTERS MAX);
    Hf, S, Cp 300, Cp 400, Cp 500, Cp600, Cp 800, Cp 1000, Cp 1500;
    ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION; PHASE (G = gas), AND CAN HAVE SOME
    ABREVIATED REFERENCE INFORMATION.  THE "LST" FILE IS THE INPUT
    FOR THE NASA FORMAT DATABASE GENERATION PROCEDURE "THERMFIT".

 END

 OPTION 5
   5 - LIST THERMO D BASE FILE {*.LST}:

    THIS OPTION ALLOWS ONE TO REVIEW THE CURRENT "LST" FILE.

    YOU CAN NOT ONLY REVIEW SPECIES NAMES BUT CAN REQUEST
    EXTENDED OUTPUT SUCH AS: 

    Hf, S, Cp 300, Cp400, Cp 500, Cp600, Cp 800, Cp 1000, Cp 1500

    A DELETE/UNDELETE OPTION IS AVAILABLE IN CASE YOU HAVE
    DUPLICATE OR INCORRECT RECORDS.

    THE "LST" FILE MUST BE REWRITTEN USING OPTION " 10 or 11" IN
    ORDER TO DELETE SPECIES FROM THE FILE.

 END

 OPTION 6
   6 - GET SPECIES FROM DOCUMENTATION FILE {*.DOC}:

    THIS OPTION REQUIRES YOU TO HAVE A DOCUMENTATION FILE
    WHICH CONTAINS ALL PERTINENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE SPECIES.
   
    THE DOCUMENTATION FILE CONTAINS:

     *    SPECIES ID & ELEMENTAL FORMULA
     *    ALL GROUPS 
     *    THERMO DATA 
     *    BOND DISSOCIATION INCREMENT (IF A RADICAL)
     *    SYMMETRY CORRECTION
     *    ANY TEXT ADDED FOR REFERENCE
     *    ANY ALTERATIONS MADE TO A CALCULATED VALUE (EDIT OPTION)
	 ETC.

    DOCUMENTATION FILE CAN BE CREATED AUTOMATICALLY WHEN
    ESTIMATING/FILING SPECIES.  

 END

 OPTION 7
    7 - ReWrite THERMO FILES {*.DOC, *.LST}:

   THIS OPTION RECALCULATES THERMO PROPERTIES.  IT IS USEFUL IF ANY 
   CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO GROUP VALUES.
   THE DOCUMENTATION FILE IS READ FOR GROUPS AND THE THERMO PROPERTIES
   ARE RECALCULATED USING THE CURRENT GROUP VALUES.

   BE WARNED:  ON AN "AT" CLASS MACHINE (10 MHz) 100 SPECIES WILL 
   REQUIRE ABOUT 5 MINUTES FOR REGENERATION OF THE DATABASE.

   A "PC" CLASS MACHINE W/ ONLY FLOPPY DRIVES WILL TAKE ~15 MINUTES.
