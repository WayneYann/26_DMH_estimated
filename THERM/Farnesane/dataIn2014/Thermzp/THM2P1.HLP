 OPTION R
      R - CALCULATE RADICAL:

 THIS OPTION ENABLES YOU TO ESTIMATE PROPERTIES OF A RADICAL
 SPECIES BY ADDING AN APPROPRIATE BOND DISSOCIATION INCREMENT TO
 THE CURRENT SPECIES.

 BOND DISSOCIATION INCREMENTS ASSUME LOSS OF A HYDROGEN ATOM FROM
 THE PARENT SPECIES.  TO ESTIMATE PHENYL RADICAL WE FIRST ESTIMATE 
 BENZENE AND THEN APPLY THE "BZ" BOND INCREMENT TO THIS SPECIES.

  R*ln(2) IS ADDED TO THE SPECIES ENTROPY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE FREE
 ELECTRON.  BOND INCREMENT GROUPS ALSO INCLUDE ANY INTERNAL ENTROPY
 CHANGE.  THE USER MUST SUPPLY THE SYMMETRY NUMBER FOR THE RADICAL,
 IN ADDITION TO IT'S NAME(ID) AND ELEMENTAL FORMULA.  

 END

 OPTION F
     F - ADD THE CURRENT SPECIES TO A FILE:

 THIS OPTION SAVES THE CURRENT SPECIES IN THE "LST" FORMAT.  IN
 ADDITION, THE DEFAULT IS TO CREATE A DOCUMENTATION FILE WHICH
 IS NECESSARY FOR AUTOMATIC UPDATE/RECALCULATION PROCEDURES 
 AVAILABLE FROM THE MAIN MENU.

 END

 OPTION H
    H - TOGGLE SHORT/LONG MENU:

 TRY THIS OPTION TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.  CHOOSING "H" A SECOND TIME WILL
 RESTORE THE CURRENT MENU FORMAT.

 END

 OPTION P
    P  -  RETURN TO THE LAST SPECIES SCREEN.
   
   This option returns the user to the previous species screen.
 END

 OPTION RETURN
   THE DEFAULT OPTION FOR THIS MENU IS TO ENTER ANOTHER SPECIES.
 END

 OPTION M
   M  -  RETURN TO THE PREVIOUS PARENT MOLECULE 
  
   THIS OPTION IS ONLY ACTIVE IF THE LAST SPECIES SCREEN CONTAINED 
  A RADICAL SPECIES.  CHOOSING THIS OPTION RESTORES THE PARENT
  IF AND ONLY IF BOND INCREMENT GROUPS WERE USED TO CALCULATE THE 
  RADICAL.

  NOTE:  CURRENT RADICAL SPECIES DATA IS DISCARDED WHEN THIS OPTION
         IS CHOSEN.  THEREFORE, YOU SHOULD FILE "F" THIS SPECIES
         BEFORE CHOOSING OPTION "M".
